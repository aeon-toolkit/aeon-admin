# Regular aeon Developer Meeting (early) - Jul 26, 2024
###### tags: `aeon-regular-dev-meeting`

#### Jul 26, 2024 @ 12:00PM UTC
#### Previous meeting: https://hackmd.io/@aeon-toolkit/rJxdHdvN0

Present: MM AG SS

### Topics

- [SS] `fit`/`predict`/`fit_predict` in anomaly detection
    - Currently, `PyODAdapter` does only support _unsupervised_ usage, however, `semi-supervised` requested
    - For `unsupervised` should `fit` just ignore input or raise an exception to prevent unexpected behavior
    - [#1837](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/1837)
    - --> change `PyODAdapter` to also support _semi-supervised_ usage, like k-Means
- [SS] Type Hinting
    - Some existing hints are incorrect, e.g. `Type[BaseEstimator]` references the class, while `BaseEstimator` references an instance of this class (https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/16a19bb8aaece13389c5f920c8f574113fe439aa/aeon/classification/sklearn/_rotation_forest_classifier.py#L109)
    - Annotating functions with types from soft-dependencies. Should we adopt [PEP 563](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/)?
    - There is no automated type checking
- [MM] Tutorials
    - Let us know if anything needs to be included in `aeon` proper before these so we can review and merge
    - MM working on EEG dataset for KDD
