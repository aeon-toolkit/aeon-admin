- Have a notebook for defining the tasks that we want to solve and later modify existing notebook to showcase usage of the new interface

- Reviewing base class structure :
    - sequence/series names -> SubSeries instead of Subsequences
    - BaseCollection or BaseSeries estimators?
    - Wheter we should have BaseSubSeries -> BaseMatrixProfile or just BaseSubSeries 
    - If we want to allow single series operation such as motif from a single series, how should we handle fit case for collection ? 
    - Have some interface to allow basic tasks such as matrix profile and distance profile from single series on top of find motif/neighbors
