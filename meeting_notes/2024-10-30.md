fixed by
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2274
Hadi to review

#### 14 other open issues
Shapelets: 
actually have these all implemented in tsml-eval: Tony to do
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/186

MP: four variants (see comment)
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/833

To do:
1. benchmark for time different implementations
2. merge transformers into one, possibly with am 
3. Option for bespoke implementation
4. similarity search to either use bespoke or stumpy


RDST: use online. Not sure there is any benefit from using online CLOSED

Coverage for SFA: still at 72%
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1oOCJgWJx.png)
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/988
The whole SFA/SFAFast division needs resolving. Suggested plan

Combine SFA/SFAFast collection transformer
Adjust TDE to use new SFA

Binary IG issue: leave for now
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/1322

Rocket GPU to regressors. Assigned to Jonathan
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/1542

Differencer series transformer. Leave for now
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/1553

Tidy up rockets: should revisit before Oz. Maybe get round to it some time.

Matthew to take a look

duplicate normalise/standard scaler
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2075

Needs looking at



Smoothing notebook: cyril self assigned

### Open PRs: 8
in reverse chronological order
1. New notebook (tony)
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2274
Hadi to review
2. similarity search (antoine) in progress
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2176

3. SAST Ivan: merged
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2006

4. Catch22 Danieli: merged
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1979

5. SFA Testing (draft) Matthew
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1884

6. Minirocket with unequal length (Tony)
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1746

7. Test pycatch22 (Hadi): Closed
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1235

Gave rise to the new issue:

Issue relates to normalised series create an issue describing and possible solutions


8. Inverse transform for standard scalar (David)
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1210
wrap this into the whole normaliser/scalar


TO DO

- [x] **Scaler/normalise etc**

https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1210
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2075

start communication on the solution, end up with one class, make invertible, close 1210
See https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2289

- [ ] **Catch22**

Sort out what is going on with normalisation, create issue, decide how to resolve

- [ ] **ROCKET**

Tony to have another go

- [ ] **Shapelets**

Tony to have another go

- [ ] **Sort out transformer output types**
    Decide on types
        Collection of series
        Single series
        (Sparse) Table
        Dense table
 
        
- [ ] Matrix profile
    Decide on which to use
    
    
## Future direction

1. Notebooks
2. tags (tag as series-to-series)?
3. Output types: list/test/restrict? unified dictionary output?
4. Duplicate collection and series transformers. Do we need them?
5. statsmodels: could try remove dependency?

No strong feelings, Tony might have a go at this
