### Topics

- [Chris] Distance module

    - **General**
        - Review `n_jobs` PR: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/2545
        - Tidy up docs, e.g. https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2856
        - Benchmark entire distance module (multi-threaded vs single-threaded vs other packages)
        - Plan blog posts documenting current implementations and comparing with other packages
            - What account are we using for Medium posts?

    - **Experimental**
        - Refactor DTW to use a JIT class and assess performance impact
            - Potentially clarifies issues like https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2429

    - **New distances to implement**
        - MVM: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/427
        - SPADE: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/426
        - SWALE: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/425
        - TQuEST: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/424
        - Review https://arxiv.org/html/2412.20574v1 for kernel methods or submodules worth implementing

    - **Discussion topics**
        - Resolve sqrt discrepancy: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/669
            - Why are results different with and without sqrt?
        - Need a mechanism to specify internal distance function without major performance hit
            - Would help resolve:
                - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/428
                - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2429
                - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/1874
            - There is potential in new numba updates this issue is solved and we can pass functions as arguments without the performance hit

    - **Issues we can close**
        - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2539 – This is a loss function, not a distance
        - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2395 – Believed resolved
        - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/1351 – PR is dead

### Needs decision

- Should we close issue #2539 as it's a loss function, not a distance?
- Should we drop dead PR #1351?
- Should we pursue JIT refactoring for DTW module-wide if no perf loss?

### Needs attention (reviews)

- PR #2545: Add `n_jobs` to distance module – needs review
- Follow up PRs refactoring classification, clustering and regression.

### Action items

- [SS] Integrate KDTW distance code further / align with Chris
- Benchmark distance module with and without `n_jobs`
- Refactor DTW to JIT class and test performance
- Draft blog post plan
- Investigate arXiv kernel method options
- Create roadmap for next year for distance module
- Benchmarks code in associated repo (maybe benchmarking repo)
- Make an issue for shape-DTW about adding more transformers 
- Chris test the hierarchical clustering results with DTW (Ward linkage may require a metric)
