        - Removal or rename of public classes and functions
        - Removal or rename of public class and function parameters
        - Addition of positional parameters (ones with default values are fine)
        - NOT default value of parameters
    - Deprecations required for 1 major version (i.e. if deprecated in v0.7.1 or v0.8.0, remove in v0.9.0)
    - Just to start with to ease in, can be refined and added to later
    - Dont introduce for v0.5.0, discuss adding to v0.6.0

        - ICDM 2024
        - ECML 2024
- Outreach: plan for teaching module based on aeon
    - Template for teaching time series machine learning content using aeon
    - Share with the wider teaching/time series community, have recorded lectures available from module experts to share with other teachers
    - Plenty in the package/domain to fill out a module
        - Intro to Time Series Data
        - Classification
        - Regression
        - Clustering
        - Forecasting
        - Anomaly Detection
        - Segmentation
        - Evaluation
        - etc.
    - In the works with Southampton
    - Looking for other universities willing to teach TSML

- New Modules: New similarity search module
    - task of finding the closest subseries in series X to given series q (<= length of X) given a similarity measure
    - AEP template uploaded to admin repo
        - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin
    - draft SS PR made, to be filled out as details as discussed
        - https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/pull/1
    - Tony creating draft base class, to discuss on base draft PR and AEP PR
- New Modules: Anomaly detection and the annotation module
    - MM AB AIF support splitting up the annotation module
        - phase out annotation slowly while adding new modules unless objections are raised
        - Raise issue
    - Leave for a bit, a lot going on currently unless someone else wants to lead.
    - Talk with Eamonn (ran https://compete.hexagon-ml.com/practice/competition/39/) and Patrick (met with folks from http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1779-wenig.pdf)
    - new slack channel
- New Modules: New condensing/averaging time series module
    - is it a transformer?
        - aeon/transformation/collection/averaging/ as a transformer
        - aeon/averaging/ as its own module
    - Cant trivially be a transformer, needs to return both X and y
    - averaging is a poor name, maybe "condensing"?
    - todo, create draft AEP and basic base PR similar to similarity search
  
- To discuss in the future:
    - Grant: Roadmap for the year
    - Grant: plan for forecasting module enhancements and grant involvement in forecasting (deep learning intern)

### Action items

- MM to edit #195 using discussed changes, request review and post in slack to move forward
- AB to update the deprecation page (https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/developer_guide/deprecation.html) in a PR and consult with core developers on slack on when to introduce the policy
- MM and AB to help with proposals for PyData Global with AIF and PyData Eindhoven with CH. No pressure to submit to these events inparticular if people are busy
- AIF to update with plans for EGC 2024 tutorial, MM and AB willing to help make proposal and some content
- AB and MM to scout out KDD 2024 for a potential aeon related tutorial
- AB, MM and AG to contribute to the similarity search AEP and base class draft PRs
