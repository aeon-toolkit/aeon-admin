Previous meeting: https://hackmd.io/-kP3kK1xRf-KBuz1n0RVfg?view

### 1. Deep Learning

- InceptionTime regressor in, other regressors planned in #225
- Issue for non-determinsitic tag and pickling
- Callbacks necessary for performance but currently not included.

### 2. Distances

- Multiple PRs up, removing class spaghetti.
- Doing one distance at a time to make reviewing easier.

### 3. Testing

- Should test non-numba compiled functions. Is this possible with the matrix design currently?
- Look into matrix testing, is it randomly assigning test or are the same tests used every time?
- More framework tests on a simple example classifier, rather than on the whole suite of estimators for stuff handled in the base class.
- Look into this https://github.com/tarpas/pytest-testmon, https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2530
- Lukasz PR a good start to removing some unnecessary forecasting testing when ready https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/pull/192
