Present: MM, SS, AIF

### Topics

- Module structure
    - collection
        - no submodules currently
    - series
        - distance_based
        - distribution_based
        - outlier_detection
        - encoding_based (empty)
            - point-based ROCKAD would fit here
            - GrammarViz
            - TARZAN
            - Series2Graph is unfortunately patented (we could use Philipp's [Series2Graph++ implementation](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/S2Gpp) (Rust with [Python-wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/s2gpp/)), which also supports multivariate data)
        - forecasting_based (empty)
            - have a new forecasting module, could be good to implement one
        - ~~reconstruction_based (empty)~~
        - deep_learning (empty)
            - We could put uynder deep_learning a reconstruction anomaly detector, one for AEs one for VAEs and have a parameter for the network used where it should have the auto-encoder tag.
            - Additional deep forecasting wrapper(s).
            - Additional self-supervised+clustering (deep learning-based clustering) wrappers linked to transformers/self_supervised

- Framework
    - Any issues with the base framework?
        - Does fit_predict make sense in some scenarios? should it be disabled or implemented separetly for some learning types?
          - we should probably have separate estimators for learning types (exclusive learning types); this also limits the API:
            - semi_supervised: `fit` and `predict` (also `fit_predict`?)
            - unsupervised: just `fit_predict` (or maybe just `predict`?)
    - tags
        - anomaly_output_type :heavy_check_mark:
        - learning type tags :heavy_check_mark:
            - learning_type:unsupervised
            - learning_type:semi_supervised
            - learning_type:supervised (not really necessary for series-AD but required for collection-AD)
            - Should we add more testing for these, i.e. to enforce setting fit_is_empty and requires_y if these are set
              - (depends on exclusivity-decision)
            - Should estimators be allows more than one or is this confusing i.e. [LOF #2865](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2865)
        - do we need anything more i.e. global/contextual and point/subsequence/correlation
            - (no)

- Open PRs
    - [ENH] Add whole-series ROCKAD anomaly detector
    - [ENH] Implementation of Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) anomaly detector
    - [ENH] Added IDK² and s-IDK² Anomaly Detector To Aeon
    - [ENH] Add DL anomaly detection algorithm: LSTM-AD


- Criteria for removing experimental notice
    - Algorithm from each domain?
    - Agreed set of tags? Already agreed
    - Any issues to be resolves first?

- Roadmap
    - Short term (within 1 year)
        - Implement at least 1 algorithm for each of the subpackages
        - Integrate new forecasting module as a wrapper/framework class
        - Make decision on learning type exclusivity
        - Improve general testing for both types of anomaly detector
        - Define framework / architecture for the deep learning detectors/algorithms
        - Removing experimental tag
    - Long term
        - Implement more recent algorithms (Monash DL clustering)
        - Benchmark implementations
        - Run a GSoC project implementing key algorithms which are currently missing
        - Add more metrics for anomaly detection to benchmarking (especially [affiliation-based](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534678.3539339)), more details: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-023-00988-8
        - Add module for thresholding anomaly scores (similar to pythresh)

### Needs decision

### Needs attention (reviews)

### Action items

- [ ] Collate into https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/pull/8 for wider developer review (maybe comment on out of scope i.e. streaming)
- [ ] [MM] create issue for learning type exclusivity
- [ ] [MM] supervised learning type issue, should it exist and what use cases are there
- [ ] [AIF] add a reconstruction based anomaly detector independent of a network, could start with LSTM anomaly detection
- [ ] [SS] Check PR: [ENH] Added IDK² and s-IDK² Anomaly Detector To Aeon

### Previous Action items

- [x] [MM] create issue for streaming (no current plans to implement so no issue created)
- [x] [MM] create issue for collection AD (PR completed and base present)
- [ ] [MM] Update AEP with current state and experimental tag discussion (was not ready yet)
- [x] [MM] create issue for subpackages in anomaly detection (completed)
- [x] [MM] Set up draft PR for whole-series anomaly detection
- [x] [TB] Contract Andreas about meeting
- [x] [SS] Create issue for Docker image (Numba caching): [#2324](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues/2324)
- [x] [SS] look through survey papers and look if our issues cover all families (good algorithms)
- [x] [SS] create issues for `PyODAdapter`-instances
