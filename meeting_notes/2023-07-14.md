Present: MM, CH, TB, AF

### Topics

- [MM] September London meetup
    - UCL room booked for either September 5th or 6th from 9am-5pm. Enough room for 8 people, but is Teams enabled with a large screen.
    - Grant can reimburse for travel and food.
- [MM] aeon distances PyData talk
    - Waiting to hear back.
- [TB] ML base class structure 
    - New base class between (BaseClassifier, BaseRegressor, BaseClusterer) and BaseEstimator.
    - Some shared functionality, but not useful for other estimators such as forecasting and annotation.
    - BaseClusterer needs some changes to conform to other base classes from similar tasks.
- [AF] Clustering deep learners
    - Working with intern from Strasburg to implement an autoencoder deep clusterer based on CNN into aeon.
    - Winner of a large comparison for DL clustering.
    - Also a recurrent neural network which won on mutlivariate.
- [AF] Averaging module?
    - May be worth moving the TS averaging package from clustering into its own module if more approaches and implemented adn are used for tasks other than clustering.
    - Would it fit into a current module better?
