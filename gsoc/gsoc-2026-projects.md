# GSoC 2026 Project Ideas

`aeon` is an open-source Python toolkit for time series machine learning algorithms, 
evaluation, and other time series related utilities. It based on the `scikit-learn` 
interface and is developed by a community of researchers and practitioners from a range 
of backgrounds. The GitHub repository for `aeon` is [here](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/), 
which contains links to our project documentation and communication channels.

As an affiliated project, `aeon` is putting forward [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
project ideas under the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) umbrella. 

All interested applicants should look at documents and FAQ listed in the `aeon` 
[GSoC README](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/blob/main/gsoc/README.md).
Failure to follow the instructions may result in your application being rejected. 
Feel free to post and ask questions on our dedicated [GSoC 2026 GitHub discussion](?)
or on our community [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-36dlmbouu-vajTShUYAHopSXUUVtHGzw).

The projects presented here are our picks for GSoC 2026. We welcome other project

## Submit your own project idea

Applicants are welcome to submit their own project ideas for GSoC 2026. If you want to 
propose your own project, you must provide a detailed description of the project, 
including the goals, expected outcomes, and a timeline. The same application
template should be used as for the projects listed above. 

If you are interested in proposing your own project, please contact us early to discuss
your idea and ensure it aligns with the goals of `aeon` and the GSoC program. The onus
will be on you to convince us that your project idea is as valuable as the ones we 
have listed. You should be able to demonstrate that you have put thought into 
your project idea and its goals. If you do not show you have the experience necessary
to complete your proposed project (i.e. machine learning or time series knowledge, if 
relevant), mentors may not be willing to take a risk.

If you propose a project without talking to anyone (especially your prospective 
mentors), it is likely that your application will be rejected. Going through this 
process and finding a mentor who wants to work with you will put you in a good place
for application evaluation. 

See our general [projects page](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/mentoring.html) 
for more project ideas.
