# GSoC 2024 Project Ideas

`aeon` is an open-source Python toolkit for time series machine learning algorithms, 
evaluation, and other time series related utilities. It based on the `scikit-learn` 
interface and is developed by a community of researchers and practitioners from a range 
of backgrounds. The GitHub repository for `aeon` is [here](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/), 
which contains links to our project documentation and communication channels.

As an affiliated project, `aeon` is putting forward [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
project ideas under the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) umbrella. We recommend that
prospective applicants look at the `aeon` [contributor guide](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/contributing.html#)
and [good first issues](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). 
Feel free to post and ask questions on our dedicated [GSoC 2025 discussion](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/discussions/2530)
or on our community [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA).

The projects presented here are our top picks for GSoC 2025. See our general [projects
page](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/mentoring.html) for more project ideas.
We are open for discussion if you are interested in another project, but we recommend
that you contact us early to discuss your ideas.
