Please read through the following resources before starting:

- [Google's instructions for participating](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)

The latest list of potential projects is available at:

- [List of ideas for projects 2025](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/blob/main/gsoc/gsoc-2025-projects.md)

Participants will need to submit their proposal(s) to [NumFOCUS on the GSoC webpage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/numfocus).
Application period opens March 24 and closes April 8.

Application templates are evailable in the [templates/](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/tree/main/gsoc/templates) 
directory. You can use either for your application to NumFOCUS. These are not mandatory, 
but may be useful. See the README within.

## Use of AI tools

We discourage the use of AI tools in the creation of GSoC applications and as the main 
provider of contributions. Using AI tools to proofread or generate menial code is 
acceptable. We do not care if you are using Copilot to generate a few lines of code if
you understand what you are submitting. If you do use any AI or LLMs in your 
contributions or proposal, please disclose their use in your PRs and/or write up. 
Additionally, you must fully understand and be able to explain any AI-generated code 
you submit. 

Having AI write your timeline and large chunks of your proposal, or submitting full PRs 
of noticeably AI-generated content is likely to disqualify your application.
Undisclosed use of AI/LLMs, or inability to explain AI-generated contributions, is 
likely to have the same result.
