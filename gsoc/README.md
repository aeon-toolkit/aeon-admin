# GSoC with `aeon`

This page provides information for participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
2025 program with the `aeon` project. Please read carefully, as failure to follow
instructions may result in your application being rejected.

Take a look at our [list of ideas for 2026 projects](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/blob/main/gsoc/gsoc-2026-projects.md).

## GSoC resources

Please read through the following resources before starting:

- [Google's GSoC contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)
- [The GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
- [NumFOCUS's GSoC contributing guide](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-students.md)
- [`aeon`'s contributor guide](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/contributing.html)

It is expected that you will follow these guidelines when making your GSoC application
and contributing to `aeon`. The instructions and rules on this page take precedence over
the general GSoC and NumFOCUS guidelines.

## Experience Requirements

Experience requirements will vary by project, and are listed in the project ideas.
We categorise projects by complexity as either Low, Medium, or High and will
expect an increasing amount of background knowledge accordingly. All projects
will require a good understanding of Python programming and Git.

- High-complexity projects are suitable for students/open-source beginners
with a strong background in the project topic:
  - For machine learning projects (i.e. developing estimators or ML framework), a 
  strong background in machine learning/data mining and an understanding of time series 
  as a data structure is required. It is expected that the applicant has completed a 
  course in machine learning at their institution or has equivalent experience. 
  Knowledge of how to properly evaluate machine learning models is expected.
  - If a high-complexity project does not involve machine learning, it is likely that we 
  expect the applicant will bring knowledge and experience with them regarding the 
  topic. Most mentors are machine learning experts and researchers rather than software
  engineers, and we will be looking to develop the project in a way that pushes the
  boundaries.
- Medium-complexity
- Low-complexity projects are suitable for most applicants. These will not 
require extensive knowledge of machine learning or time series analysis, and any 
requirements should be at the level beginners can pick up. Knowledge of 
basic Python programming skills and Git are still required.

## Rules

- code of conduct
- wrappers and code copying (we are aware other implementations exist)
- PRs and issues
- AI
- template

## Use of AI tools

We discourage the use of AI tools in the creation of GSoC applications and as the main 
provider of contributions. Using AI tools to proofread or generate menial code is 
acceptable. We do not care if you are using Copilot to generate a few lines of code if
you understand what you are submitting. If you do use any AI or LLMs in your 
contributions or proposal, please disclose their use in your PRs and/or write up. 
Additionally, you must fully understand and be able to explain any AI-generated code 
you submit. 

Having AI write your timeline and large chunks of your proposal, or submitting full PRs 
of noticeably AI-generated content is likely to disqualify your application.
Undisclosed use of AI/LLMs, or inability to explain AI-generated contributions, is 
likely to have the same result.

## Making an application

Participants will need to submit their proposal(s) to [NumFOCUS on the GSoC webpage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/numfocus).
The application submission period opens ? and closes ?.

Applicants must use the scections in the `aeon` template are evailable in the [templates/](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon-admin/tree/main/gsoc/templates) 
directory. You can use either for your application to NumFOCUS. These are not mandatory, 
but may be useful. See the README within.

- project title rules
- page and font size limit
- make sure your PDF renders correctly (has working links). attention to detail
- PR required
- - change somthing to stop introduction spam.

## FAQ

please review my PR - we would like to but this is dependant on the availability of developers during the application period where traffic is heavy. You can add unmerged PRs to your application and PRs to other orgs
can you assign me to issue #Z - read the contributor guide and only do so if you are confident you can complete it and respond to reviews
review my application - no
i love project X, please teach me more about X - (most likely) no
Project X only mentions algotrithm Y, is that all you want - possibly but probably lot
There is a lot more algorithms that can added to my proposal for project X, should i add them - depends. one exellent well tested implementation is better than three mediocre ones which will be difficult to maintain. If you want to propose a small or large number of implementation, you better make sure we think it is worth it.
details on starting the project opne (sure but no PRs)
