# GSoC 2024 Project Ideas

`aeon` is an open-source Python toolkit for time series machine learning algorithms, 
evaluation, and other time series related utilities. It based on the `scikit-learn` 
interface and is developed by a community of researchers and practitioners from a range 
of backgrounds.

As an affiliated project, `aeon` is putting forward Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024
project ideas under the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) umbrella. We recommend that
prospective applicants look at the `aeon` [contributor guide](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/contributing.html#)
and [good first issues](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
