This directory includes templates for making a GSoC application. You do not
have to use either of these templates, but they include useful guidance for
what we would want to see in a proposal and help the reviewing process. 
If necessary, you can alter the templates to better display your skills and knowledge 
of the project.

Templates:
- NumFOCUS: The NumFOCUS proposal template from [numfocus/gsoc](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/templates/proposal.md)
- aeon: An altered version of the [Internet Health Report](https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/gsoc) template for `aeon`
